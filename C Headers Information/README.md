## 42 C Projects
All C projects at 42 require you to have a header on-top of your .c file that looks something like this:

To create this header, you can do either of the following:

- In the .c file, type in ```:Stdheader``` or use the keyboard commands ```FN``` + ```ESC``` + ```F1```

This will be for explaining the use of headers and system headers in C (eg. #include <unistd.h>)
