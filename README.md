# 42-Adelaide
I was part of the 1st ever piscine at 42 Adelaide between June - July of 2021. </br>

What the piscine teaches you is the following:

- Vim or Visual Studio Code (depending on which one you use)
- iTerm/Terminal
- C Language Programming
- Shell Commands
- Git
- GitHub
- Use an iMac well =)
- Discord
and much more. 

# Piscine Tips

Feel stuck on a question?
Do either or all of the following:

- Ask anyone and everyone and show them what's happening.
- Check the Discord by either typing your problem in the right channel or searching the whole server in the top right corner of the Discord application. 
- Google Search the specific problem.
</br>

Evaluations </br>
Recommend you open eval slots as much as you can, that way you get a couple of things out of it.

- You meet them 1 on 1 and get to know them more and their skillset.
- You get 1 eval point for every eval done.
- They explain their code to you, which helps you further understand the project. 
- You have a copy of their repo, which could you figure out their logic.
</br>
Schedule
</br>
Week 1:</br>
Shell00, Shell01, C00. </br>

- Learn the shell projects on Monday and Tuesday. On Wednesday, start on the C projects (C00) as the exam itself is on the C Language.</br>
- Suggest you work on the 1st Rush (Rush00) to get an idea of what a group coding project is like. 

</br>
Week 2:

C00, C01 and C02. </br>

- Contine with Projects C00 and C01 this week. </br>
- Focus on the C Projects this weekend rather then the Rush project, if you missed the first Rush (Rush00), then maybe take part in this Rush project (Rush01). </br> 
- For those that ain't doing the Rush, prepare for exam on weekends and know your mistakes that you made on the previous exams and continue with your C Projects. 

</br>
Week 3: 

C02, C03 and C04. </br>

- If you missed the first and second Rush projects (Rush00 & Rush01), then don't really worry about this Rush project (Rush02). </br>
- This week continue with your C Projects and prepare for the Exam Preparation. Improving your C concepts & coding skills, along with your algorithms.

</br>
Week 4: 

C04, C05 and C06 (with possibly C07 if you want to)

- This week continue with your C Projects and suggest that from Wednesday onwards to prepare for your final exam.
- Continue and push your C Projects on the final weekend of the piscine as Sunday at 5pm, the 42 Intra closes and piscine is over.  
</br>
NOTE: Don't stress with the exams, I failed the first 3 exams (Exam 00, Exam 01 and Exam 02) and only passed the last exam (Exam 03). 

# C Projects Checklist
A checklist you can use before you submit your C Projects. 

- Make sure all of the right files are there and are named correctly, check the c.pdf if needed.
- Run Norminette in the folder of your C Projects in iTerm.
- Make sure all .c projects have headers in them, to place a header type in vim - :Stdheader
- gcc to compile your .c project
- Make sure only the .c files are in there and not any a.out or other files are there. 
- Git clone your repo before clicking on 'set project as finished' to check that everything is there. 

# Submit a C Project
Quickest way to submit a C project.

1 - Head to the intra C project page (link to the intra - intra.42.fr) </br>
2 - Copy the link of that C project git repo in the intra C project page. </br>
3 - With that link, head over to iTerm and cd into desktop. </br>
4 - Once you have cd into desktop, type in the following - git clone <paste url link from intra here> (space) type in Project name here. </br>
5 - Hit enter and the repo from the intra will popup on your desktop. </br>
6 - Copy the projects from your other C folder that you are submitting into this folder that you git cloned from the intra. </br>
7 - Once you have copied the .c files over to this git cloned folder, do the following:

Type in shell, the following commands in order to submit your C Project:
- git status
- git add * (* - the star adds all of your .c files all together instead of .c files in one at a time).
- git status (shows all of your .c files have been added - make sure only .c shows up and remove the files other files like - a.out, etc.).
- git commit -m "leave a commit message here"
- git push

You have now pushed your project!

Before you click on 'Set Project as Finished' on the 42 Intra C Project page, make sure to git clone that Intra C Project to make sure all of 
the folders and .c files are in there. 

If all of the folders and .c files are there, go ahead and click on 'Set Project as Finished', subscribe to 2 evaluations and good luck!
If you folders and .c files ain't all there, go back to Step 1 and repeat the proccess.
