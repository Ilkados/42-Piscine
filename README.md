# 42-Adelaide
I was part of the 1st ever piscine at 42 Adelaide between June - July of 2021. </br>

# Piscine Tips
Week 1:

Shell00, Shell01, C00. </br>

- Learn the shell projects on Monday and Tuesday, but by Wednesday, start on the C projects (C00) as the exam itself is on the C Language.</br>
- Suggest you work on the 1st Rush (Rush00) to get an idea of what a group coding project is like. 

</br>
Week 2:

C01 and C02. </br>

- Contine with Projects C00 and C01 this week. </br>
- Focus on the C Projects this weekend rather then the Rush project, if you missed the first Rush (Rush00), then maybe take part in this Rush project (Rush01). </br> 
- For those that ain't doing the Rush, prepare for exam on weekends and know your mistakes that you made on the previous exams and continue with your C Projects. 

</br>
Week 3: 

C03 and C04. </br>

- If you missed the first and second Rush projects (Rush00 & Rush01), then don't really worry about this Rush project (Rush02). </br>
- This week continue with your C Projects and Exam Preparation. Improving your C concepts & coding skills, along your algorithms.

</br>
Week 4: 

C05 and C06 (with possibly C07 if you want to)

- This week continue with your C Projects and suggest that from Wednesday onwards to prepare for your final exam.
