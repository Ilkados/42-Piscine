# 42-Adelaide
I was part of the 1st ever piscine at 42 Adelaide between June - July of 2021. </br>

What the piscine teaches you is the following:

- Vim or Visual Studio Code (depending on which one you use)
- iTerm/Terminal
- C Language Programming
- Shell Commands
- Git
- GitHub
- Use an iMac well =)
- Discord
and much more. 

# Piscine Tips

Feel stuck on a question?
Do either or all of the following:

- Ask anyone and everyone and show them what's happening.
- Check the Discord by either typing your problem in the right channel or searching the whole server in the top right corner of the Discord application. 
- Google Search the specific problem.

Schedule

Week 1:</br>
Shell00, Shell01, C00. </br>

- Learn the shell projects on Monday and Tuesday. On Wednesday, start on the C projects (C00) as the exam itself is on the C Language.</br>
- Suggest you work on the 1st Rush (Rush00) to get an idea of what a group coding project is like. 

</br>
Week 2:

C00, C01 and C02. </br>

- Contine with Projects C00 and C01 this week. </br>
- Focus on the C Projects this weekend rather then the Rush project, if you missed the first Rush (Rush00), then maybe take part in this Rush project (Rush01). </br> 
- For those that ain't doing the Rush, prepare for exam on weekends and know your mistakes that you made on the previous exams and continue with your C Projects. 

</br>
Week 3: 

C02, C03 and C04. </br>

- If you missed the first and second Rush projects (Rush00 & Rush01), then don't really worry about this Rush project (Rush02). </br>
- This week continue with your C Projects and prepare for the Exam Preparation. Improving your C concepts & coding skills, along with your algorithms.

</br>
Week 4: 

C04, C05 and C06 (with possibly C07 if you want to)

- This week continue with your C Projects and suggest that from Wednesday onwards to prepare for your final exam.
- Continue and push your C Projects on the final weekend of the piscine as Sunday at 5pm, the 42 Intra closes and piscine is over.  
</br>
NOTE: Don't stress with the exams, I failed the first 3 exams (Exam 00, Exam 01 and Exam 02) and only passed the last exam (Exam 03). 

# C Projects Checklist
A checklist you can use before you submit your C Projects. 

- Make sure all of the right files are there and are named correctly, check the c.pdf if needed.
- Run Norminette in the folder of your C Projects in iTerm.
- Make sure all .c projects have headers in them, to place a header type in vim - :Stdheader
- gcc to compile your .c project
- Make sure only the .c files are in there and not any a.out or other files are there. 
- Git clone your repo before clicking on 'set project as finished' to check that everything is there.
