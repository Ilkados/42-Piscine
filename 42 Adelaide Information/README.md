# 42-Adelaide
I was part of the 1st ever piscine at 42 Adelaide between June - July of 2021 📆 </br>

What the piscine teaches you is the following:

- Vim or Visual Studio Code (depending on which one you use)
- iTerm
- C Language Programming 
- Shell Commands
- Git
- GitHub
- Use an iMac well =)
- Discord
- Nuclino
- Stack Overflow

and so many soft skills!

# iMac 
The biggest thing people find annoying using the iMacs on 42 Campus is the mouse itself, usually it's slow and such, to fix that do this: 


1 - Click on the Apple symbol 🍎 in the top left of the desktop 🖥️ </br>
2 - Then click on System Preferences (second one down 🔽) </br>
3 - Then click on Mouse 🖱️ </br>
4 - Change the Tracking Speed, Scroll Direction, Scrolling and Secondary Button. </br>
5 - Then click on the x ❌ in the top left corner.

# Feeling Stuck?

**Feel stuck on a question?** </br>
Do either or all of the following:

- Ask anyone and everyone and show them what's happening.
- Check the Discord by either typing your problem in the right channel or searching the whole server in the top right corner of the Discord application. 
- Google Search the specific problem.
- Check out specific sites like GitHub and Stack Overflow. 

# Best Desktop Setup
Recommend best setup you should have on your desktop when you are on 42 Campus:

- 1st FireFox Browser Window (42 Intra, Discord & Nuclino Tabs)
- 2nd Browser Window (To Research The Project & any GitHub Tabs) 
- 1st iTerm Window (To do your C Project in)
- 2nd iTerm Window (For Normintette and Compiling the C Project)

# 42 School
To increase your chance to get into the 42 School, I would recommend the following:
- Complete enough C Projects
- Pass an exam
- Do alot of evals
- Get alot of Voxtron votes

Note: Nothing is guaranteed though as the 42 Entrance to the school isn't public information.
